# About 
Hi,

I am Merul, I had started my coding journey with game development in Unity 4 years ago and it has been a hell of a ride! I am a full stack developer who specializes in Scripting and Desktop Application Development! 

I am a contributor to [Liquid Galaxy](https://www.liquidgalaxy.eu) and I have worked on several of their projects

I am one of the finalists of Google Code-in 2019 and I have won multiple coding contests hosted by big organisations! Coodos is my initiative to provide no-compromise tech products to you!

# Some of my works

## [Croply Trace](https://trace.croply.org)
> Front-end Revamped by [Danish](https://github.com/danishsinghsethi/) and I :)

> My Role : Lead Developer 

Croply Trace is an application I developed for one of my clients, Trace is a complete farm to fork traceability system for farmers, consumers, producers and retailers. It is a system purpose built to ensure traceability in food as there is barely any at the moment, it allows everyone along the supply chain to add records and modify data and the consumer can quickly see the complete journy their food has gone through in one simple scan.

## [Croply Website](https://croply.org)
> credits to [Sahil](https://github.com/sahil2004/) for Help with frontend

> My Role : Lead Developer [ I did the whole backend and some of the Frontend ]

Well it is pretty self-explanatory, I made the main website for Croply along with Sahil :) 

## [Project OVA](https://github.com/coodos/openVoiceAssistant)
> Made it in collaboration with [Soham Jaiswal](https://github.com/sohamjaiswal10) 
> My Role : Lead Developer

Project Open Voice Assistant (OVA) is my most ambitious project yet! this project aims to be a replacement to all the corporate spying voice assistants that are there. this voice assistant is very reliable and the best part is that it does not steal one's data.

## [Lifeline](https://lifeline-codehack.herokuapp.com/)
> credits to [Sahil](https://github.com/sahil2004/) for Help with frontend and [Danish](https://github.com/danishsinghsethi/) for help with UI/UX <br>
> My Role : Team Leader and Full Stack Developer [ I did the whole backend and some of the Frontend ]

A mental health support platform made for people to talk and relieve stress

## [Cookbook Magic](https://cookbookmagic.herokuapp.com/)
> My Role : Full Stack Developer [ I worked on this all by myself ]

A platform where users can dynamically generate recipe E-Books

## [Liquid Galaxy Accelerometer App](https://github.com/coodos/liquidGalaxyAccelerometerCapture)
> My Role : Made it all by myself

Initially I was supposed to be refactoring an app from 2011 but I just ended up building it from the ground up :P
